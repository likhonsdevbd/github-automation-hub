## Research Strategy
- Search for official GitHub documentation and best practices
- Find industry case studies and real-world implementations
- Look for recent trends and emerging patterns (2024-2025)
- Gather practical examples and code snippets
- Document tool integrations and ecosystem patterns

## Source Documentation
- Use sources_add to track all research sources
- Ensure diverse source types (official docs, tutorials, case studies)
- Verify information across multiple sources

## Final Deliverable
- Comprehensive report in docs/automation_research/github_actions_ci_cd.md
- Structured according to the 7 research areas
- Include practical examples and code snippets
- Provide actionable insights and recommendations
