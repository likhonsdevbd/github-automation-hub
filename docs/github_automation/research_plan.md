# GitHub Automation Research Plan

## Task Overview
Research GitHub automation best practices and rate limiting strategies focusing on 5 key areas:
1. GitHub API rate limits and safe automation thresholds
2. Human-like automation patterns
3. Daily contribution automation strategies
4. Repository growth techniques
5. Community engagement automation
